Hello Friends,
 I'm Neha, Started learning Fullstack Web Development Course and this is the beginning of my work. 
 In this Repo you will find My profile, made using only HTML and CSS.
 Further, as I learn other skills like Bootstrap and JavaScript I will add those to it, that's it for now.
 I hope you will find it learnable.
 Thank you!!


HTML=>
1. All possible and mostly used tags are included.
2. Important note would like to mention is that, HTML contains the semantic tag and if you skip tags like html, head, or body still HTML does not through any error you can cross-check it on your own but using these primary tags helps you and to browser to understand the flow of the code.


CSS=>
1. As I'm in the phase of learning Web Development so as much I can make it good I made it by applying CSS.
2. there are numbers of CSS properties you can learn by using W3 school.
